# **Raycasting Maze Game**

## Introduction
Welcome to the **Raycasting Maze Game**! This project is a first-person 3D maze game developed in C using the SDL library. It uses raycasting to generate a dynamic, immersive perspective, allowing players to explore and navigate through a maze from a first-person view.

Players can move, turn, and avoid obstacles, with the ultimate goal of reaching the exit.
